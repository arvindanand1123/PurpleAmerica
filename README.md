Every four years the time comes for America to pick a new president (or choose to stick with the old one) and political news a spin flies wildly.  Amidst all this coverage, we often see a familiar map of the US showing each state as either red or blue.  This is to show which candidate won each state and it helps to clarify election results but it also creates a misrepresentation of the opinions of the American citizens.  What we are going to try to do is create a more realistic representation of the American public.  
	The traditional “Red State/Blue State” map is created by determining the color of each state by checking which side got the most votes.  What we are going to do is make each state a blend of Red and Blue (and Green for independent) based on the percentage of votes won by each party.  This will result in a large Purple map that changes subtly by each state.  We will make this program adaptable so that it can generate a map of the US that separates by state or that separates by state and county.  It should also be able to generate a map of just a certain state (decided by the user) that is separated by county.
